I am a postdoctoral research associate at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My mentor is Justin Sawon. [Justin Sawon](http://sawon.web.unc.edu)

I obtained my Ph.D from Indiana University at Bloomington. My advisor was Valery Lunts. 

My research interest is algebraic geometry, in particular derived categories, moduli space of sheaves and quiver representations.
