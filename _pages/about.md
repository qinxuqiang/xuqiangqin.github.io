I am a final year graduate student at Indiana University at Bloomington. My advisor is Valery Lunts. Starting Fall 2020, I will be a postdoc at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

My research interest is algebraic geometry, in particular derived categories, moduli space of sheaves and quiver representations.
