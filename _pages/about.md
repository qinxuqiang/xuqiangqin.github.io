I am a postdoctoral research associate at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My mentor is [Justin Sawon](http://sawon.web.unc.edu).

I obtained my Ph.D from Indiana University Bloomington. My advisor was [Valery Lunts](https://math.indiana.edu/about/faculty/lunts-valery.html).

My research interest is algebraic geometry, in particular derived categories, moduli space of sheaves and quiver representations.
